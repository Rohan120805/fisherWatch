# Tower Data Web Application

A secure web application for managing tower data with mutual TLS authentication.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- MongoDB
- OpenSSL
- Git

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rohan120805/fisherWatch.git
```

2. Create certificate directories:
```bash
mkdir certs
```
```bash
mkdir certs\ca
```
```bash
mkdir certs\server
```
```bash
mkdir certs\client
```

3. Generate SSL certificates using OpenSSL:

# 1. Generate CA private key and certificate
```bash
openssl genrsa -out certs/ca/ca.key 4096
```
```bash
openssl req -x509 -new -nodes -key certs/ca/ca.key -sha256 -days 3650 -out certs/ca/ca.crt -subj "/CN=FisherWatch"
```
# 2. Generate server private key and CSR
```bash
openssl genrsa -out certs/server/server.key 4096
```
```bash
openssl req -new -key certs/server/server.key -out certs/server/server.csr -subj "/CN=localhost"
```
# 3. Generate server certificate signed by CA
```bash
openssl x509 -req -in certs/server/server.csr -CA certs/ca/ca.crt -CAkey certs/ca/ca.key -CAcreateserial -out certs/server/server.crt -days 365 -sha256
```
# 4. Generate client private key and CSR
```bash
openssl genrsa -out certs/client/client.key 4096
```
```bash
openssl req -new -key certs/client/client.key -out certs/client/client.csr -subj "/CN=client"
```
# 5. Generate client certificate signed by CA
```bash
openssl x509 -req -in certs/client/client.csr -CA certs/ca/ca.crt -CAkey certs/ca/ca.key -CAcreateserial -out certs/client/client.crt -days 365 -sha256
```

4. Install backend dependencies:

```bash
cd backend
```
```bash
npm install
```

5. Install frontend dependencies:

```bash
cd ../frontend
```
```bash
npm install
```

6. Configure environment variables:
# Create .env file in the root directory:

```
MONGO_LOCAL_URI=mongodb://0.0.0.0:27017/towers
PORT=5000
SERVER=https://localhost:5000
CLIENT=http://localhost:5173
SSL_CA_PATH=../certs/ca/ca.crt
SSL_CERT_PATH=../certs/server/server.crt
SSL_KEY_PATH=../certs/server/server.key
```

# Create .env file in the frontend directory:

```
VITE_API_URL=https://localhost:5000
VITE_CLIENT_CERT_PATH=../certs/client/client.crt
VITE_CLIENT_KEY_PATH=../certs/client/client.key
VITE_CA_CERT_PATH=../certs/ca/ca.crt
SERVER_KEY_PATH=../certs/server/server.key
SERVER_CERT_PATH=../certs/server/server.crt
VITE_PORT=5173
```

## Testing with Postman

### Configure Mutual TLS Authentication in Postman

1. Open Postman and create a new request
2. Go to Settings (Gear Icon) > Certificates
3. Add Client Certificate:
   - Host: localhost:5000
   - CRT file: /certs/client/client.crt
   - KEY file: /certs/client/client.key
   - CA file: /certs/ca/ca.crt

### Send Data to API Endpoints

1. **Add Tower Data**
```bash
POST https://localhost:5000/api/towers
```
```bash
Content-Type: application/json
```

### Browser Configuration

#### Creating Combined Certificate for Browser

1. Create PKCS#12 (.p12) file combining client certificate and private key:
```bash
openssl pkcs12 -export -out certs/client/client.p12 -inkey certs/client/client.key -in certs/client/client.crt -certfile certs/ca/ca.crt
```

#### Importing Certificates in Chrome

1. Import Client Certificate:
   - Open Chrome Settings (â‹® menu > Settings)
   - Navigate to Privacy and security > Security > Manage certificates
   - Go to "Your Certificates" tab
   - Click "Import"
   - Select `certs/client/client.p12`
   - Enter the password you set when creating the .p12 file

2. Import CA Certificate (if needed):
   - In Chrome Settings > Security > Manage certificates
   - Go to "Trusted Root Certification Authorities" tab
   - Click "Import"
   - Select `certs/ca/ca.crt`

3. Restart Chrome

After configuration, when visiting `https://localhost:5000`:
   - Chrome will recognize your client certificate
   - Present it automatically to the server
   - Allow secure access to the application

7. Running the Application:
# Note: Run these commands in the root directory of the project.

# To run the Application in Development mode:
```bash
npm run dev
```

# To deploy the Application:
```bash
npm run deploy
```

### User Management

#### Creating a New User
1. **Register User**
```bash
POST https://localhost:5000/api/users/register
```
```bash
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "userId": "your_user_id",
    "password": "your_password"
}
```

If you want to disable "Register New User Feature", go to backend\controllers\user.controller.js and remove 'register' function and remove
```bash
router.post('/register', register);
```
line from backend\routes\user.routes.js.
